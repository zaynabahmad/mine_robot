# mine_robot

**This document introduces a  mine detection robot designed for navigating potentially hazardous environments. The robot utilizes three infrared (IR) sensors: one facing forward and one on each side for obstacle detection.  These sensors, along with a mine detector sensor, guide the robot's movement.  Two DC motors propel the robot, allowing for forward and backward motion,  as well as turning capabilities.**

## for the software system of the project

### the archeticure of the system

* THE APP LAYER
* THE HAL LAYER
* THE MCAL LAYER
* THE SERVICES OF THE UTILS LAYER

## KINDLY THIS THE PROJECT FOR THE USAGE :

> THIS PROJECT MADE MAINLY ON AN AVR (ATMEGA 32 ) MICROCONTROLLER
>
>> COULD MODIFY TO WORK ON ANOTHER CHIP BY MODIFY THE ADDRESSES IN THE PRIVATE FILES IN THE MCAL LAYER
>>

### USING

> INSTALL THE PROJECT 

> BUILD THE PROJECT

> BURN  ON A CHIP USING A PROGRAMMER FOR AVR
