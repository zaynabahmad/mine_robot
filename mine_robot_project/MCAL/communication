medium (wire , wireless)
///     wire       ,       wireless 
cose  based on dis, based on tech
security high    , low 
mobility low     , high 

transmission tech : serial or parrell 

serial : one wire bit by bit  low speed  
parrell : 8 wires between mcu and the other one high speed

dis adv of the parell
complex connection 
cross talk (magnetic)
clock skew (wire is speed than another wire ) , data not send to the target in same time 


data direction 
1- simplex (to be sender or receiver )
2- half duplex (can send and receive data but not in the same time ) (talki)
3- full duplex (can send and receive data in the same time ) (mobile phone )



receiver and transmitter relationship 
peer to peer  device to talk to one device 
salve , master 
	single master multislave 
	multi master multisalve 
	multi master no slave 
	
	
synchronisation 
synchronous                     , asynchrouns 
based on the clock have a bit for the clock  , based on a speed 


throughput : related to frame formate 
the useful data in the frame 
----------------------------------------------------------------
any communication protocol 
specs 
HW interface 
farme formate 


UART 
univisal asyncrouns receiver tramsimitter 
USART (not standard )  
universal synchronous asynchronous receiver transmitter 

the standard is like the can , lin , ethernet 

--------------------------------------------
UART (hardware interface )
TX, RX 
PD1, PD0
	TX > output 
	RX > input 
(you should unit the ground)
--------------
UART 
specs 
	wired or wireless 
	if we want it to be wireless it will connect to the wifi or bluetooth and the bluetooth will be wireless 

Serial 
peer to peer 
full duplex 
throuput ??()
--------------
frame format 
start bit       ,the bits (data 5, 6, 7,8,9 ), parity bit (check mechanism ), stop bit(bit or two ) 
from high to low ,        (data )            ,                              ,  

tx > idle state (high ) no connectio  so also the rx will be also high 
if it will be in the idle state it will not transmite the data 


the parity is a check mechanisim (odd , even )
odd parity the number of 1's includes the parity bit which is 1 will be odd 
even parity the number os 0's includes the parity bit which is 0 will be even 
(if the number of 1's is odd the parity bit will be 1 and if it is even the parity will be 0 )

the data could be wrong and it will not configure that is wrong 

------------------------------------------
throuput = useful data /total data 
min = 5/ 1+5+1+1=55 %
max = 9/1+9+0+1= 81%
tp from 55% to 81% 
------------ note >> the perfect tp will be in the spi it send data will 100%
--------------------------------------------

speed 
--> bps : bit per second 
--> bps :byte per second 
--> fps : frame per second 
--> bound rate : symbol per second
